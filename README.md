# Caesar Cipher

This simple project is an implementation of Caesar Cipher. I created a function that takes a string and a key, then outputs the encrypted message. This also preserves case and wraps from "z" to "a".

Some of the things I learned includes:
* Using a **range** to define an interval (the alphabet in this case)
* Using the **each** method
* Using the **shovel operator** to append new items to an array
* Understanding **implicit** versus **explicit** return values
